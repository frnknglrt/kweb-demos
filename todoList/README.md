# Todo List App

This app showcases many of kweb's features. Use `gradlew run` to start 
the server, and then open http://localhost:7659 in your browser. Try 
visiting the same list URL in two different browser windows and notice
how they synchronize in real time.

This project also demonstrates how to use [shoebox](https://github.com/kwebio/shoebox)
for reactive persistence.
